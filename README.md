# Regression Visualizer

A quick interactive tool to create, train, and visualize regression models using various pre-built algorithms built so that I could get my hands dirty with the tech stack provided below.

## Features
- Visualize 2D datasets with interactive Streamlit graphs
- Upload your own CSV data to explore and model
- Save datasets to compare across sessions
- Generate synthetic regression datasets
- Add different settings of noise to see how model performance changes
- Track loss across different regression models.

## Getting Started!
- TODO

## Tech Stack
- Frontend: Streamlit, requests, altair, numpy, pandas
- Backend: FastAPI, uvicorn, SQLAlchemy, pydantic, pytest, 
See the pyproject.toml files in the frontend and backend folders for a more detailed breakdown of the project requirements.
